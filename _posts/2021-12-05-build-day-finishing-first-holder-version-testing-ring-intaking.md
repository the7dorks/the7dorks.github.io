##### Holder-2.0.1

Today we finished the first version of the holder mechanism.

##### Conveyor-2.0.0

###### Test

The rubber bands help pull the mobile goal in stronger and because they are on an angle, they also pull it down so the hooks grab onto the goal right away.
It seems to work well, but the goal needs to be centered, and in just the right position. We probably need to add a mechanical funnel to ensure the goal is centered. Also, the hooks are very small. It might be easiest to add another cylinder if we need to, but hopefully we don’t need to. Really, we won’t be able to tell how consistent it is until we practice driving with it.

###### Create
- We also added a gear ratio on the ring intake to make it 400rpm, because 200 and 600 rpm were too slow and too fast respectively.
- We also added a black lexan shroud to try to bounce rings onto the mobile goal post, but it didn’t work very well.
