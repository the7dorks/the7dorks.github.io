##### Conveyor-2.0.1
###### Test

When intaking Rings, it works better than before, but it still jams quite a bit.

##### Conveyor-2.0.2

###### Create

We raised the intake roller with the new space we have from moving the ramp back to prevent jamming

###### Test

This configuration had a deadzone where the intake would not reach rings right after the roller.


##### Conveyor-2.1.0

###### Create 

We added a tensioner bar to press the chain down right after the roller to solve this problem.

###### Test

The tensioner was too low, and caused jamming like before.
