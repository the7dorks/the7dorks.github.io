##### Robot-2.0.0

Now that we had the CAD designs all done, it was time to plan out the building process. 

###### Management

We decided as a team we want to finish this robot before winter break (12/18â€“1/2), which means we should build most of it by 12/13. Because we are planning on going to the Northeast Wisconsin Signature event at the beginning of February, we should have at least 2 full weeks of practicing at programming, and it will probably take about 2 weeks to iron out random problems that arise in the building process. Because we are mostly going to be busy with our families over winter break, these four weeks need to happen in January, so we should be finished building before we all get busy.
