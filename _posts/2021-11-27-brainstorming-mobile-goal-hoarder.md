##### Holder-2.0.0
We also wanted to build and design a new holder for the back of our robot.

###### Design

- Initial and final positions of the mobile goal in a possible holder configuration, with the mobile goal rotating about a standoff shown by the red dot.

 - Actually implementing pneumatics to make this happen:


    - Lever: overly complicated

    - Pulling hook: easier to build, and easier to make follow the path we want it to. One issue: it might be difficult to make the pneumatic hook release the goal, because it would somehow need to go up.
