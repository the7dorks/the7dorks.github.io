##### Drivetrain 1.0.0
Today we followed the CAD and built our first drivetrain

###### Create
- We put 1x3x1 bracing on the drivetrain, because we realized 1x2x1s probably werenâ€™t enough to brace the mogo gearbox.
- We had to move each side of the lift one hole closer in for it to fit in the drivetrain. We miscounted when we built it.
