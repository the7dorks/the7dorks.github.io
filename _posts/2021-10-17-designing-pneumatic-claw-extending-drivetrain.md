##### Drivetrain-1.0.1
Acting on our decision from August 16, we began modifying our previous design to hold three Mobile Goals. 

###### Design
- This required us to lengthen our drivetrain to provide the necessary balance and stability to hold Mobile Goals. The best way to do this would be to rebuild the drivetrain, however, this would take a lot of time, and would provide only marginal benefit, so we decided to instead extend the drivetrain using c-channel couplers and adding low friction unpowered wheels to the end.
- These wheels will act as an anti-tip mechanism to prevent the robot from tipping over while holding heavy mobile goals.

###### Create
We extended our drivetrain and added unpowered wheels to give the robot a wider base and improve balance when holding Mobile Goals.

###### Test
These wheels can spin freely for at least 20 seconds in our testing, which is a very minimal amount of friction. They are mounted sturdily, and the robot is much less tippy. This achieves our design goals just as we wanted.

##### Claw-1.0.0
Next, we needed a claw to pick up Mobile Goals.

###### Design
Using a double acting cylinder, some c-channels, and a simple join we designed our first claw.

###### Create
We then built the claw and attached it to the four bar lift.

###### Test
It can hold onto Mobile Goals, but not very tightly. We will probably want to improve this in the future.
