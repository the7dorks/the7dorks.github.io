##### Conveyor-2.1.4

###### Create

- We added a lexan top to direct rings to the mobile goal branch. It works well, (about 80% of the time in our testing):<br><img class="responsive-img" width="500" src="/assets/pics/building/robot-2/LexonTop.jpg">
- We had to remove the very back of the ring intake, because it was sticking out of 18”

- We also moved the whole thing back 2 holes because it was out of 18. It was easiest to move the 1x3x1 metal back, which required us to change the back bracing, which didn’t have any functional effect on the rings:<br><img class="responsive-img" width="400" src="/assets/pics/building/robot-2/BackBracing.jpg">

###### Test 

After the changes to the ring intake to make it fit in 18, it fails most of the time. 13/30 Rings were scored on the branch.

- We added bracing at the bottom of lift. To make sure everything was aligned well, we loosened the screws holding the tower to the drivetrain, put the triangle braces on, then tightened everything. Even with shoulder screws, the towers could wiggle forward and backward a small amount (when the screws were loose), so to make sure each tower was perfectly aligned with the other for minimal lift friction, we make the triangle bracing slightly too small, to force the towers to be at the far-back of the range. They are still essentially vertical, but very well aligned with each other.<br><img class="responsive-img" width="400" src="/assets/pics/building/robot-2/LiftBrace.jpg">
- To make the towers even better aligned, we added a c-channel at the top of the towers. This addition was not in the cad, but it does not interfere with anything, so it shouldn’t be a problem.
