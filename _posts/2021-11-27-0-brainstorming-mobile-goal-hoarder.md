##### Holder-2.0.0
- <mark>Based on our decision in "Research: Looking at More Recent Robots | Brainstorming: New Robot?" on 11/22/2021, we need some sort of ring intaking conveyor.</mark>
- We also want to make it use as little air as possible, to save more clamping strength for the claw.

###### Design

- Initial and final positions of the mobile goal in a possible holder configuration, with the mobile goal rotating about a standoff shown by the red dot.

- Actually implementing pneumatics to make this happen:


    - Lever: overly complicated

    - Pulling hook: easier to build, and easier to make follow the path we want it to. One issue: it might be difficult to make the pneumatic hook release the goal, because it would somehow need to go up.
