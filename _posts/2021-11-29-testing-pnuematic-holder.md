##### Holder-2.0.0

Now that we had a general idea for the new holder for our bot, it was time to test the design out. 

###### Test 

Here is the testing version of the holder that we made to see how it would preform. We build a basic drivetrain chassis that we won't actually use, but it has the same dimensions of the one we are going to build, so it can be a representative test.

###### Reflect

<mark>It worked as well as we could have hoped.</mark> The issue of releasing the mobile goal still exists, but otherwise, this design seems like it will work.
