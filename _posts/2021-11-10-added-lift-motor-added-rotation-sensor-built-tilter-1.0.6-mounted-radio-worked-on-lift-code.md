##### Lift-1.0.1
 
We now wanted to try to test and practice driving with our robot. To do this we needed to add the motor to the lift. 
 
###### Create
 
- We added the motor to the side of our lift
- We mounted a Rotational Sensor to the lift, allowing us to know its position at all times
- Worked on new code for the lift using the Rotational Sensor

##### Robot-1
 
We also had to add the radio in order to start practicing.
 
###### Create
 
- We added the Radio to the top of our robot
- We decided to mount the Radio on standoffs with rubber from Omni-Directional Wheels
- The rubber can absorb vibrations to prevent problems communicating with the Controller
- The rubber also prevents static from reaching the Radio by creating a break in conductors.
