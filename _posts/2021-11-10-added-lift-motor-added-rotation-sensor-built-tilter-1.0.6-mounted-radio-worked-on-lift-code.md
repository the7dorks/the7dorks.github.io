##### Lift-1.0.1

We now wanted to try to test and pratice driving with our robot. Do do this we needed to add the motor to the lift. 

###### Create

- We added the motor to the side of our lift
- We mounted a Rotational Sensor to the lift, allowing us to know its postion at all times
- Worked on new code for the lift using the Rotational Sensor
