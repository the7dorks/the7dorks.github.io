##### Pneumatic Reservoir-1.0

###### Create

To power our pneumatic systems we needed to add pneumatic reservoirs to store pressurized air. Since the reservoirs are heavy we attached two to the robot and made sure they were opposite of one another to balance the weight. We also attached them higher up on the robot to ensure easy access to the valve for quick refilling before matches. Finally, both reservoirs are connected to one another to provide double the air capacity and double to actuations for our claw.

##### Holder-1.0.1

###### Create

Continuing on our construction from 11/02, we added bracing to the back of the Mobile Goal holder and a gear to attach it to a motor on the robot. This will make the holder sturdier when holding heavy game elements and allow it to rotate and raise the Mobile Goals above the ground.

###### Test

The bracing made this holder extremely sturdy and it does not bend or flex when holding elements.

###### Reflect

The construction so far is extremely sturdy and the holder will hold up to repeated use in competition.
