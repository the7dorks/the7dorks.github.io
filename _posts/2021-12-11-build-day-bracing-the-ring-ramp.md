##### Conveyor-2.1.3

###### Create

Braced the bottom of the ring ramp. We hope this will result in the intake no longer bouncing around.<br><img class="responsive-img" width="450" src="/assets/pics/building/robot-2/Braced.jpg">

###### Test

This helped a lot and stopped it from bouncing around. Now it is very sturdy. We also will probably be able to brace this to the lift towers, making both this ramp and the lift more sturdy.
