##### Conveyor-2.1.5
###### Create

We added half-c channels to prevent the rings from falling out the back. It’s on a joint so that rings can’t get stuck on it, and the mobile goal can’t get caught when we try to set the goal down.

###### Test
- In our test from before, Rings flew out the back about 3 in 10 times, but now we haven't had it happen once after around 40 Rings tested.
- When we set the goal down, the c channels move out of the way, and don't interfere
- This was a successful change.
