##### Robot-1 
We decided to add the Brian to the robot.

##### Holder-1.0.1
We also attached the Moblie Goal holder to the back of our robot. This allows us to grab two goals at once. It also opens up the possiblity of parking on the platform with two Moblie Goals and a robot.

##### Claw-2.0.0
We wanted a claw that was more reliable and applyed more force to the Mobile Goals to stop them from falling out when moving around the feild. This also is useful incase another team trys to steal a Mobile Goal from our claw.  

###### Design
- We once again decided to use pneumatic to try to create a claw, allowing us to save motors for other purposes.
- This time we decided to use 2 double acting cylinders instead of one to increase the grip strength.
- Though it decreased the amount of times the claw could trigger, we believe the pros outweigh the cons.
- -We also decided on a claw that was bigger and more solid than our previous designs. 

###### Create
We built the claw and discovered that it would be more effective to put a c-channel under the claw to help more firmly grip Mobile Goals and hold them in place. Then we attached the claw to the bot and mounted it onto the end of our lift and added some structure to firmly hold the claw in place.
