##### Research
###### 99484C Two Stage Lift
In Turning Point, this team used a two stage lift for reaching short poles and high poles, <mark>similar to how we need to reach two distinct heights of Mobile Goal Branches</mark>. The first stage could rotate independently of the second stage:

Then the second stage could simply lift the first higher up in the air:

###### In the Zone Mobile Goal Dragger
On the VEXForum today, user "lascap" posted an example of team in In the Zone dragging two Mobile Goals behind their Robot to prevent the opposing Alliance from getting them:

We could do something similar to this, even not needing to dedicate a motor to it because we can use pneumatics. It also might be possible to just drag Mobile Goals by latching into the "bowl" of the Mobile Goal Base instead of using a bulky arm like the above example.

##### Brainstorming
###### Robot-0.2.2: Two Stage Lift Combination Robot
<mark>Like Turning Point team 99484C, we thought we could use a two stage lift to be able to raise Rings to the different heights of Mobile Goal Branches. We synthesized this with VIQC Ringmaster team 12580F's ring storing mechanism that rotates to dump rings onto scoring posts and 21549A's conveyor ring intake (Research: Past Games, 5/23/2021).</mark> We can intake Rings with this conveyor onto a storage pole that is attached to a two stage lift that can rotate to dump Rings onto Mobile Goal Branches. The vertical purple line represents a stage of the lift that can bring the ring storage arm higher to reach higher Mobile Goal Branches:

###### Robot-0.2.3: Mobile Goal Lifting Robot
Another idea we had was a Robot that can hold two Mobile Goals, but also has the ability to lift them high enough to Elevate them on the Platform without driving up it. This could be very helpful in Robot Skills where we will need to balance Mobile Goals on a platform without a Robot, and it could be helpful in head-to-head Matches in outrunning the opposing Alliance at "hoarding" Mobile Goals, because it would quickly put the Mobile Goals in a position that is difficult for the opposing Alliance to get to. We do not yet have very much of a plan of how a Robot like this would work.
