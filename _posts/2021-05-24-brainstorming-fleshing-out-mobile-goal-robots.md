##### Robot-0.1 Improvements
Mobile Goal hoarding Robots are still viable, so we should consider them until we have a plan that is definitely better.

###### Robot-0.1.1 Forklift Design
A handful of teammates did not understand how Mobile Goals would slide into the right place with this design, so Jac drew a more detailed sketch of the forklift:

The efficacy of this design is dependant on how well the Mobile Goals push each other into a "shingled" position, because the lift does not always force the Mobile Goals into the same position as each other. If they do not "shingle" well, we could hold three Mobile Goals like this, which is more predictable:

###### Robot-0.1.3 Forklift Design
A handful of teammates did not understand how Mobile Goals would slide into the right place with this design, so Porter drew a more detailed sketch of the forklift. On this version, both forklifts would be geared together so they could each share two motors worth of power:
