We moved the drivetrain bracing bar farther back, because the intake roller was too close to the ring ramp, causing jams for certain ring orientations. After seeing how much room the mogo tilter takes up, we saw that there was plenty of room to move the ring intake back, which would give us more room to make the intake roller farther from the ring ramp, allowing it to get rings in more orientations.
