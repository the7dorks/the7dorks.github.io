##### Lift-1.0.1
 
We now wanted to try to test and practice driving with our robot. To do this we needed to add the motor to the lift. 
 
###### Create
 
- We added the motor to the side of our lift
- We mounted a Rotational Sensor to the lift, allowing us to know its position at all times
- Worked on new code for the lift using the Rotational Sensor
- Added a triangle of rubber bands to the lift to help counteract gravity's uneven pull on the lift

###### Test 

The lift worked great and was very much improved by the rubber bands.

##### Robot-1
 
We also had to add the radio in order to start practicing.
 
###### Create
 
- We added the Radio to the top of our robot
- We decided to mount the Radio on standoffs with rubber from Omni-Directional Wheels
- The rubber can absorb vibrations to prevent problems communicating with the Controller
- The rubber also prevents static from reaching the Radio by creating a break in conductors.

##### Holder-1.1.1

After we added a lexon ramp in Holder 1.1.0 to allow us to hold 3 mobile goals we where happy by the results but realized we lost some range. We found the lexon was blocking the Mobile Goal from going all the way into our grabber before the holder was powered. 

###### Build

We found the most effective way to do this was to add two Standoffs in order to extend the range and stop Mobile Goals from slipping out of the unpowerd grabber. 

###### Test

The Grabber worked a lot better with the Standoffs and fixed our range problem.
