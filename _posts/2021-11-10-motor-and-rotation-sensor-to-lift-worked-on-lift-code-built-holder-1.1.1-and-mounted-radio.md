##### Lift-1.0.1
 
We now wanted to try to test and practice driving with our robot. To do this we needed to add the motor to the lift. 
 
###### Create
 
- We added the motor to the side of our lift
- We mounted a Rotational Sensor to the lift, allowing us to know its position at all times
- Worked on new code for the lift using the Rotational Sensor

##### Robot-1
 
We also had to add the radio in order to start practicing.
 
###### Create
 
- We added the Radio to the top of our robot
- We decided to mount the Radio on standoffs with rubber from Omni-Directional Wheels
- The rubber can absorb vibrations to prevent problems communicating with the Controller
- The rubber also prevents static from reaching the Radio by creating a break in conductors.

##### Holder-1.1.1

We had a little trouble lining up Mobile Goals with our grabber on the back. We decided that making something that would line up and then hold the stem of the goal would be the best solution for this.

###### Build

We found the most effective way to do this was to add two Standoffs to our grabber to guide the Mobile Goals in.
