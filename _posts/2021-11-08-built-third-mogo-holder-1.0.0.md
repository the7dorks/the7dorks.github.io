##### Holder-1.1.0
Now that our robot was able to hold two Mobile Goals at once, we wanted to expand that to 3. The easiest way to do that would be to modify and add to the back holder of our robot
###### Research
We saw that a lot of teams where able to grab 3 Moblie Goals in some way. One team that had lots of documentation about there robot was 60883D. They also had a design that was very easy to modifY to fit our robot and playstyle. We decided on a similer design that would mean we would not have to change anything about our holder and just add onto it.

###### Create
We then mounted the desgin to our holder. We only had had a few problems while trying to mount it and soon had our agreed apon desgin on the back of our robot.

###### Test
We found that even though we changed a lot of desgin elements from 60883D, our newly desgined holder worked very effectivly, allowing us to grab 3 Mobile Goals at once.
