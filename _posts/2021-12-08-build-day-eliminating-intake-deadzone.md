##### Conveyor-2.1.0

When we tested our conveyor for the rings yesterday we found there was an area where the rings could not be collected. Today we wanted to find a simple solution to help reduce this area.

###### Create

Moved tensioner to get rid of the deadzone where the rings were not being picked up by our intake.<br><img class="responsive-img" width="350" src="/assets/pics/building/robot-2/Movedd.jpg">

###### Test 

This really helped reduce the deadzone, but there was still a small deadzone where rings could not get collected. We hope to do more tests tomorrow to further fix this problem and eliminate the deadzone.
