Today we finished the lift. The only changes we made to the CAD were the two metal crossbars going between each side of the lift. We added these bars just so we can more easily test the intake roller and the ring conveyor. While mirroring the left side to create the right side, we did not put the bearings directly above the bearing for the bottom roller, because there is not going to be a motor on the right side, so we will not need an extra sprocket to transfer power to the conveyor.
