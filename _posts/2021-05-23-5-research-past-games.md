Looking at robotics competitions from years past with similar game elements can be a good source of inspiration.

##### VRC Round UP (2010-2011)
Round Up is the most similar to Tipping Point, with teams scoring rings on tippable mobile goals. We could use all of the following designs in Tipping Point.

###### 5812B Ring Conveyor
This team used a "c-shaped" conveyor system with <mark>tank tread flaps to pick up the rings</mark>:

###### 2931C "Needle" Ring Intake
This team used a "needle" type intake that pokes into the opening of the ring. <mark>The needle has sets of sprockets that rotate to bring the ring up the needle:</mark>

###### 3018 "Sleeve" Ring Intake
This team used a design similar to 2931C, but with the <mark>sprockets on the outside of the rings</mark> instead of the inside:

##### VRC Skyrise (2014-2015)
###### 118 Hooked Conveyor
This team used a slanted <mark>conveyor with hooks</mark> for holding Skyrise cubes. We could make similar hooks for moving Rings.

##### VRC In the Zone (2017-2018)
Much like Tipping Point, In the Zone had Mobile Goals, Zones to score the Mobile Goals, and an abundance of elements to score on the Mobile Goals. A significant difference is that Tipping Point now has Mobile Goals that can score for either Alliance.

###### 5225A Tipping Opposing Alliance Mobile Goals
In the World Finals Matches, this <mark>team tipped over the opposing Alliance's Mobile Goals</mark> a handful of times, which was difficult for the opposing Alliance to undo:

###### 6627A Lift Rubber Banding
This team used an interesting method of rubber banding their heavy lift, which could be useful.

###### "Antichamber" Drivetrain / Mobile Goal Lift transmission
User "Antichamber" posted a video of a drivetrain and Mobile Goal lift each powered by the same motors. This could be very useful for us if we want a motor-powered Mobile Goal lift without needing to use any extra motors. This design of <mark>grabbing Mobile Goals from the plastic rims</mark> is also viable in Tipping Point.

When the motors on each side spin in the same direction, the drivetrain drives. When they spin in opposite directions, the lift moves.

###### 8059 Double Mobile Goal Lift
This team used a Mobile Goal lift design very similar to many other In the Zone teams, but it could hold two Mobile Goals:

##### VIQC Ringmaster (2017-2018)
Ringmaster involves scoring rings onto poles, similar to Tipping Point.

###### 12580F
This team (along with most successful Ringmaster teams) used poles for storing different colored rings. To score the rings, they would <mark>rotate the poles to dump the rings off</mark>. While sorting Rings is not important in Tipping Point, this method might be useful for storing and scoring.

###### 21549A Conveyor Ring Intake
Similar to VRC Round Up team 5812B, this team used an tread conveyor to scrape rings off the ground and lift them up the robot:

##### FTC Ultimate Goal (2020-2021)
While very different from Tipping Point, this game involved the manipulation of rings.

###### Kuriosty Robotics Indexer
This team appears to have used rubber-band-like tank treads for moving rings within the robot. The fact that these treads appear to deform well likely helps control the rings in any position.

##### VRC Tipping Point (2021-2022)
###### Game Reveal Video Example Robot
The robot shown in the Tipping Point game announcement video had a very simple mechanism for holding Mobile Goals, that appeared to be powered with only one motor:
