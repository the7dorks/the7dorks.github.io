##### Holder-1.0.0
To make the robot hold more Mobile Goals as we decided on 8/16/2021, we need some mechanism powered by motors.

###### Design
- Our first idea was to make something to wrap around the circular bottom of Mobile Goals, but that wouldn't be more effective than just a sturdy square, so we started building a square.
- The square will tip up and bring a Mobile Goal with it.

###### Create

To prevent the Mobile Goal from tipping, we put a bar that goes above the top back:

###### Test
Using our hands to move this new holder similar to how it will move when attached to the robot, it seems to work very well:
- The Mobile Goal slides in easily.
- When tilted back, it is well secured.
