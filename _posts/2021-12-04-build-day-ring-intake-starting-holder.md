###### Create

Today we put on flaps to help move the rings through the robot.

##### Holder-2.0.1
###### Create

We also continued building the holder mechanism. It is very wobbly, but it seems to be in a good position on the robot. It doesnâ€™t get in the way of anything, and it looks like it will angle the goals in the right way.
