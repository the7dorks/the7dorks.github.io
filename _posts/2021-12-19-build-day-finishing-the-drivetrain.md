We finished the second half to our drivetrain. We tested the friction on the wheels and they were able to spin freely for about 3 seconds. Having low friction on a drivetrain is very important because it reduces the amount of work the motors have to do, and because the robot will have to do lots of heavy lifting the easier we can make it for the motors the better.<br><img class="responsive-img" width="600" src="/assets/pics/Photos-001/20211217_195455.jpg">
