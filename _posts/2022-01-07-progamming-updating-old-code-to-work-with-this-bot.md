The LiftStateMachine explained in "Build Day: Motor and Rotation Sensor to Lift, Worked on lift Code, Built Holder 1.1.1,and Mounted Radio" on 11/10/2021 for the last robot will be functionally identical when adapted for this bot. Additionally, a similar state machine design was used for our ring intake and for the pneumatic holder. Because most of the code is exactly the same, we won't put it here.
