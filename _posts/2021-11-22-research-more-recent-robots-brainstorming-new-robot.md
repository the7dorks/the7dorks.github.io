##### Design
We shared the github repository that this notebook is hosted in with 333B to make it easier for us to share CAD designs, because sharing with Inventor is difficult otherwise.

##### Research
###### 9181W Skills Video
Today we  analyzed 9181Wâ€™s programming skills video and got several ideas for designs to explore. The first is to use a combination of standoffs and zipties to hold a Mobile Goal in the robot shown below. This could prove useful for a more efficient mMobile Goal holder.

The lift on this robot sticks out a lot farther than ours does which allows them to stick farther over the lip of the Platform and elevate Mobile Goals much more quickly.

Finally their layout of a Ring intake and Mobile Goal lift on one end with a Mobile Goal holder on the other for loading Rings seems very optimal because it allows them to fill a Mobile Goal with Rings while also holding and then elevating a Mobile Gaol with the other side. It also leaves
