##### Intake-2.0.0

We wanted to make some kind of ring conveyor.

###### Design 

- Spacing of rollers approximated based on how the Rings look in the cad. There is a good chance this is wrong, but this design makes it VERY easy to change, just by adding/removing spacing on the standoffs.

- It’s angle and length are supposed to line up well with the top of alliance goals, but both of these variables are also very easy to change:it’s attached at the base with a hinge, so we could tilt it to whatever angle works best, then add bracing to keep it in the right place.

##### Lift-2.0.0

###### Design

- We decided on a four bar lift because it keeps the mobile goals level with the ground which makes it easier to place/remove goals on the Platform.

- The lift is positioned as far back on the robot as possible to keep the robot from tipping. Also, the length of the arms are just right to be able to reach goals far back on the platform (to make it easier to descore opposing mobile goals), and also able to reach higher than the high end of the platform when it’s tilted down. This will hopefully make balancing the platform easier.

##### Robot-2.0.0

At the end of the day we managed to make our simple ring conveyor, four bar lift, and claw in one fianl desgin.
