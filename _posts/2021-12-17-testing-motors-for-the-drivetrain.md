##### Testing Motors
In our experience, we have discovered that not all V5 motors perform at the same level, so for the drivetrain, which needs to be very fast, and very consistent, we will sort through the motors to find the best ones.

###### Method
We can easily graph the velocity of the motors at full power to the screen of the brain to compare their outputs. As you can see, not all are the same, with the green motor significantly slower than the others:<br>

###### Results
After testing 32 motors, we found 6 very high performing ones for the drivetrain.
