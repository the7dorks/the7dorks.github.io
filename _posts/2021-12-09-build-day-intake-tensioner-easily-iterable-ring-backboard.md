##### Conveyor-2.1.1 

Once again we needed a way to minimize the deadzone of our ring intake. 

###### Create

Added another tensioner next to the other to get rid of the remaining deadzone while intaking rings.

###### Test 

It is able to collect rings from any angle and works as we hoped. 

##### Conveyor-2.1.2 

###### Create

Also replaced the lexan shroud that we had before with c channels. This means they are easier to fine tune and change on the fly.

###### Test
To test this design, we turned on the intakes and fed rings into the bottom in "random" positions. <mark>It successfully scored 7/20 Rings</mark>, which is okay, but we will work on improving it in the future.
